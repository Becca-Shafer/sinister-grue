            Hello! This is my second semester in the Learning Design and Technology MS program.  I received my BA in Anthropology and Religious Studies from USF in 2010.  After graduating I spent some time in the social work field as a counselor on the Florida Abuse Hotline and later as a case manager at an at-risk youth shelter.  I made the switch to education/IT in 2014, starting out as a computer lab manager at an elementary school.  I am currently the Technology Coordinator at a charter school in Manatee County.
            </p>

            <p>
            In my spare time, I play the violin and viola - most recently in the Bradenton Symphony Orchestra in the 2019-2020 season before Covid struck. Occasionally I join my husband Dan on stage in our band, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6qQpb2TecEJPqytzt4dFxc" target="_blank">The Dram</a>. We have two young boys, ages 5 and 3. In the remaining free time I have, I enjoy board games, video games, escape rooms, crossword puzzles, and photography.  And sleep.
